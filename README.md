**This is a MBR overwriter malware.**

**So what is MBR**?

**A master boot record (MBR) is a special type of boot sector at the very beginning of partitioned computer mass storage devices like fixed disks or removable drives intended for use with IBM PC-compatible systems and beyond. The concept of MBRs was publicly introduced in 1983 with PC DOS 2.0.**

**This malware simply overwrites the MBR, leaving the machine unbootable.**
