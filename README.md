#### Made with MBR Builder

This is a MBR overwrite.

So **what is MBR**?
A master boot record (MBR) is a special type of boot sector at the very beginning of partitioned computer mass storage devices like fixed disks or removable drives intended for use with IBM PC-compatible systems and beyond. The concept of MBRs was publicly introduced in 1983 with PC DOS 2.0.

This simply overwrites the MBR ,leaving the machine unbootable.
